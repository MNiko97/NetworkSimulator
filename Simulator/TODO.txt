IN NUCLEARPS.CS :
    -Changing state still not operationnal

IN POWERSTATIONNODE.CS :
    -import correctly stateNode
    -correct problem inside "setcurrentPower", for the moment, 
    solarPS and WindPS ahve a problem where they start with 100% weather intensity 
    but I stated it otherwise... I DONT KNOW HO TO CHANGE THAT. (minor problem)

IN SOLAR AND WIND PS :
weather intensity doesn't get updated with the network. (network.weather.setSolarIntensity(0);)
have to delete the setSolar and setWind functions when weather intensity update is working.
