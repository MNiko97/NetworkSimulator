IN NUCLEARPS.CS :
    -Changing state still not operationnal

IN POWERSTATIONNODE.CS :
    -import correctly stateNode
    -implement flexibility (flexible,constant,weather dependent)
    -correct problem inside "setcurrentPower", for the moment, solarPS and WindPS ahve a problem where they start with 100% weather intensity but I stated it otherwise...
